## Realm Editor
Realm Editor is a tool to work with [Realm](https://realm.io)
 database files in a graphical environment, instead of working directly with schema files.
 
Realm Editor reads database files from its own data directory, so in order to open your .realm files, you should import them, then a copy of your database will be created in data directory. After manipulating your database you can export that.
